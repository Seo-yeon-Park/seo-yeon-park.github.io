										<!-- <p>A philosophy PhD student</p>-->
									</header>
									<p> I am a PhD candidate in philosophy at the <a href="https://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/"><b>University of Pittsburgh</b></a>.<br />
										Before that, I studied Mechanical Engineering and Philosophy at Seoul National University. <br /><br />

										Focusing on questions about the <b>formal structure</b> of representation and reasoning, I am interested in the philosophy of logic and language, and metaphilosophy.
										Although I work on contemporary topics, I try to locate my project within the rich history of philosophy, especially inspired by Kant and Frege. <br /><br />

										My ambition is to <b>place logic in reality</b>. I believe in logical realism by which I mean that logical truths are true in virtue of formal or structural aspect of the world, not in virtue of something dependent on human mind, language, or convention.
										To me, logical laws are universal and necessary in the strongest sense, which provide the principles for factual matters to be arranged in reality.<br />
										Nonetheless, I agree that the best way for logical inquiry is reflecting on languages in which our reasoning takes place.
										But this is not because logical laws are determined in an anti-realist way but our language has been shaped to represent reality that is formed in accordance with logical laws. <br />
										In this sense, I am a metaphysical anti-exceptionalist but epistemologically exceptionalist about logic. Logical claims are true by how things really are, as like scientific claims are, but they can be known only through a mediate way of reflection.
										
										<br /><br />

										Thinking about how reflection can be a way of forming knowledge, I find Kant inspiring and helpful. Relatedly, I am interested in contemporary debate on self-knowledge with a sympathy to Kantian reflectivist side. <br /><br />
										
										I have side interests in philosophy of science, particularly in the explanatory power of idealized models and the meaning and reasoning capacities of Large Language Models.<br /><br />

												<h4>The Interlocking Problem for Logical Anti-Realism</h4>
												<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
													
												<p>Logical anti-realism is the view that logical truths answer to no features of mind-and-language-independent reality. Treating logical truths as fundamentally unlike ordinary and scientific truths, logical anti-realism requires a dualist metasemantics, where the meanings of logical expressions are grounded entirely in rules internal to language while those of others are grounded in causal connections to the external world. I develop what I call the Interlocking Problem: a dualist metasemantics is untenable whenever its two components are not both complete and coherent, failing to ensure that all meaningful expressions receive a cogent metasemantic account. I illustrate the problem by showing how it arises for Jared Warren’s conventionalist version of logical anti-realism. His systematic dualist metasemantics combines inferentialist metasemantics for logical terms with a causal metasemantics for empirical terms. Yet the Interlocking Problem undermines Warren’s dualism. First, it fails completeness since the meanings of some significant metaphysical terms remain underdetermined by either component. Second, it fails coherence in cases of overdetermination where its two components assign incompatible meanings to a single expression. I conclude by noting that the problems Warren faces are instances of a general structural worry for dualist metasemantics, and so represent a salient obstacle that any similar logical anti-realist view would have to overcome. </p>

												<h4>Two Questions of Logic (Under Review)</h4>
												<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
													
												<p>Kripke’s ‘The Question of Logic’ ignited a surge of interest in the Adoption Problem, a challenge to the coherence of adopting a special subset of logical principles. However, from an exegetical standpoint the fixation on the Adoption Problem risks overlooking the central message of Kripke’s paper. His text contains broad and unusually forceful commitments about the nature of logic that cannot be justified by any lesson one could draw from the Adoption Problem. Partly on this basis, I argue that Kripke in fact presents two distinct challenges: the well-known Adoption Problem and what I call the Interpretation Problem. The Interpretation Problem suggests that the idea of adopting a logic by choosing one among several formal systems is ultimately incoherent. In particular, Kripke provides reasons to think that one cannot so much as interpret formal systems of logic, in the sense that one cannot specify how the formal systems can guide reasoning, unless engaging in reasoning that prejudges matters in favor of a system conforming to that reasoning. It turns out that the Interpretation Problem has extensive implications for the nature of logic that provide support for Kripke’s strongest claims about it.</p>

												<h4>Self-Knowledge, Transparency, and Rational Agency</h4>
												<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
													
												<p>Intentional states are ‘transparent’ in that we can know our own intentional states by considering only the external states of affairs represented by them. I delve into how we come to acquire beliefs about our own intentional states transparently and why they should be knowledge rather than mere beliefs. Transparency is grounded in the rational agent’s capacity for reason-sensitivity to engage in reason-based cognitions in accordance with rational norms. These reason-based cognitions presuppose implicit understandings of our attitudes toward the pertinent contents. I argue that it is these implicit understandings from which we come to acquire self-knowledge about our intentional states transparently. <!-- To see the draft, <b>click the image on the left side</b>. --></p>

												<!--<h4>Anscombe on First-Person Reference</h4>
												<p>In “The First Person”, Anscombe proposes the Non-Reference Thesis that the first-person pronoun “I” does not refer to anything. I reconstruct her argument: “I” is not a referring expression because my use of “I” is not mediated by any conception of myself. This idea is articulated in Intention where Anscombe suggests self-knowledge of action is non-observational, for the knower does not depend on any observation to identify herself as the subject. However, I show that this argument works only within a controversial framework of reference. Therefore, the Non-Reference Thesis can be denied while acknowledging Anscombe’s insights about self-knowledge. </p>

												<!-- <h4>How Idealized Models Explain and Represent Real-Worlds Systems</h4>-->
												<!-- <details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>-->
													
												<!-- <p>Models help us explain and predict the behavior of complex systems. However, models typically contain idealizations, false assumptions about real-world systems. My goal is to clarify the role of models in scientific explanation. I claim that models enable the regularities underlying real-world systems to be epistemically accessible. My analysis of Galilean and non-Galilean models reveals that idealizations are necessary for the model to play this role. This means that models represent real-world systems in virtue of idealizations. I argue that such model-based representations are irreducible to more familiar kinds of representation, exploring when model-based representations are regarded as correct. </p>-->

											<h4>Kant's Conception of Logic as Self-Knowledge through Reflection</h4>	
											<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
																						
											<p>My goal is to clarify Kant's conception of logic as self-knowledge of the understanding as to the mere form of thought, considering its methodological consequence: logic develops through mere reflection. Reflection is a function of the understanding that results in the concept of a common feature of various representations. I first examine what it means that logic is the science of the mere form of thought as such. There are two forms of thought that render thoughts with different types of unity. The first is the synthetic form that determines how a thought ought to relate to its object. The second is the analytic form that constitutes the way a thought ought to be related to each other. I propose that Kant’s logic employs the reflection on higher-order representations about thoughts, which are themselves representations of objects, with respect to their forms. Referring to Jäsche Logic, I outline the process of this higher-order reflection for logic. Reflection as to the synthetic form generates transcendental logic, and reflection as to the analytic form yields pure general logic. My account will reveal that these two kinds of reflection correspond to transcendental reflection and logical reflection presented in Amphiboly.</p>
